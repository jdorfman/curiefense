Curiefense is a new application security platform, which protects sites, services, and APIs. It extends Envoy proxy to defend against a variety of threats, including SQL and command injection, cross site scripting (XSS), account takeovers (ATOs), application-layer DDoS, remote file inclusion (RFI), API abuse, and more.

Curiefense extends Envoy proxy to protect all forms of web traffi. It inspects every request and analyzes it according to its security policies. Some of these are inherent, some are customized by the user, some are received from external threat feeds, and some are automatically generated and adapted as the threat environment evolves.

We named this project after the famous scientist Marie Curie. It began in intensive work sessions at Malakoff France, close to her home and laboratory in the outskirts of Paris, and is being released on her birthday (November 7).

But this is just the beginning. We already have an extensive roadmap for additional capabilities, which will be available in our Curiefense github soon. Weâ€™re eager to receive feedback, opinions and ideas from the community, so we can make the platform even better than we could on our own.
